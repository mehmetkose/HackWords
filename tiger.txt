And so your life's been a success
And you have pleasure in excess
Don't worry it will all end soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
And so your future's looking bright
And you've reached the giddy heights
Don't worry it will soon end
It is all shallow and pretend

The crack of doom
Is coming soon
The crack of doom
Is coming soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

And so your life
Your life has failed
You've made the progress of a snail
Don't worry you'll get your revenge
For we're all equal in the end
The small and mighty all the same
This life a shallow, facile game
Where every empire turns to dust
And every ego will be crushed

The crack of doom
Is coming soon
The crack of doom
Is coming soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
ha-ha

And every dream, hope and desire
Is just a flicker in the fire
And that fire it will consume
The crack of doom
Is coming soon

The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom
doom
Is coming soon
